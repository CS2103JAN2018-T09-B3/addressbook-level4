== Introduction

ProgressChecker is for *CS2103/T students* who *prefer to use a desktop app* to keep track of their learning progress throughout the module. More importantly, ProgressChecker is *optimized for students who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ProgressChecker can get your learning outcome tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

Getting started with ProgressChecker is as easy as downloading and launching the software in a couple of clicks! Listed below are the important steps that you will need to follow to get started:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `progresschecker.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ProgressChecker.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

[NOTE]
====
The viewing of learning outcomes and exercises are not ready yet! Only some of week 3's exercises are reflected and they are in the midst of bug fixing.
====
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts

* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com m/Computer Science y/2` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book. He is in his 2nd year majoring in computer engineering.

* **`+issue`**`ti/TestIssue` : creates an issue on github in the team repo

* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

You may find having to learn a large new number of commands rather intimidating. The section below specifies all the commands in details with examples to help you overcome that learning curve and let you make the best out of ProgressChecker.

====
*Command Format*

* The commands are case-insensitive. However, for simplicity all the examples have the commands in lower case.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
