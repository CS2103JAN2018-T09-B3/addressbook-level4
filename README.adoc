* This is a desktop Progress Checker application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java sample application intended for students taking module CS2103/T as a means of tracking both their learning outcomes and practice exercises.
* It is meant to be a helper software used together with the https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s2.github.io/website/index.html[official CS2103/T module website].
